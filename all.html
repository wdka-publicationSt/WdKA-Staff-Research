<h1 id="preface">PREFACE</h1>
<p>Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual--he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.</p>
<p>The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story--that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p>Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.</p>
<p>THE AUTHOR.</p>
<p>HARTFORD, 1876.</p>

<p>“TOM!”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>“TOM!”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>“What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the</p>
<p>room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or</p>
<p>never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were</p>
<p>her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not</p>
<p>service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.</p>
<p>She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but</p>
<p>still loud enough for the furniture to hear:</p>
<p>“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--”</p>
<p>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching</p>
<p>under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the</p>
<p>punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.</p>
<p>“I never did see the beat of that boy!”</p>
<p>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the</p>
<p>tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So</p>
<p>she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:</p>
<p>“Y-o-u-u TOM!”</p>
<p>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize</p>
<p>a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.</p>
<p>“There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in</p>
<p>there?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that</p>
<p>truck?”</p>
<p>“I don't know, aunt.”</p>
<h1 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h1>
<p>SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and</p>
<p>fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if</p>
<p>the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in</p>
<p>every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom</p>
<p>and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond</p>
<p>the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far</p>
<p>enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.</p>
<p>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a</p>
<p>long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and</p>
<p>a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board</p>
<p>fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a</p>
<p>burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost</p>
<p>plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant</p>
<p>whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed</p>
<p>fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at</p>
<p>the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from</p>
<p>the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but</p>
<p>now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at</p>
<p>the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there</p>
<p>waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,</p>
<p>skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred</p>
<p>and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an</p>
<p>hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:</p>
<p>“Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.”</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p>The programme of the Commercial Practice, Willem de Kooning Academy Rotterdam, explores possible approaches for art and design education in times of economic and industrial transformations. This development is fused by digitalisation and technological innovations, but also by a bottom-up, participatory drive from consumers and citizens.</p>
<p><strong>How can we relate to these rapidly changing developments from the perspective of art and design education?</strong> Which skills, attitudes, and methods are needed to equip art and design students for this future landscape in order to be able to position themselves in it? This article discusses the relevance of relating creative approaches, like speculation, to real-life innovations. Based upon examples from the curriculum, it proposes an interdisciplinary, participatory design approach to arrive at new innovations that are inclusive.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Paradigm Shifts: A Possible Role For Art and Design Education</strong></p>
<p>The current economic and industrial landscape is transforming rapidly. On a daily basis, new products, services, platforms, and markets are emerging, fused by technological innovations and digitalisation, and increasingly driven by consumers, citizens, and communities. There are many perspectives on this landscape in flux, such as the ‘sharing’ economy (Benkler, 2004),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the horizontal economy, or the Next Economy (Rifkin, 2017).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>These concepts redefine traditional models of production, transaction, distribution, and, accordingly, authorship and ownership. In today’s economic spectrum we can see an emergence of initiatives that express a bottom-up or <em>DIY/DIWO</em> mentality and a shift from mass production to markets of one. The maker culture, for example, fosters collaborations between amateurs and professionals through networks and accessible, high-end technologies (FabLabs, maker spaces) to create new markets for specific communities and individuals. According to the ideology of “free innovation,” consumers develop innovations themselves and give them away for free (Von Hippel, 2017).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> “Jugaad innovation” is based upon frugal innovation from emerging communities in countries like India, China, and Africa. This method has meanwhile been developed into a strategy for mainstream innovation (Radjou, Prabhu &amp; Ahuja, 2012).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> These practices show that what has traditionally been perceived as innovation (a top-down, highly structured process) is changing into a more unruly, bottom-up and inclusive way of developing new products.</p>
<p>In this transforming economic and industrial environment the traditional hierarchies between industries, companies, producers, designers, and consumers are radically changing. This paradigm shift transforms the way we design, what we design, and for whom.</p>
<p>How can art and design education equip students for this transforming socio-economic environment? Which indispensable skills and attitudes enable them to respond to an economic culture of digitalisation, bottom-up initiatives, inclusive innovation, markets of one, and ever-emerging technologies?</p>
<p><strong>Next Economy, Next Design?</strong></p>
<p>The programme of Willem de Kooning Academy’s Commercial Practice explores and questions the aforementioned developments and investigates their relevance for art and design students. Its point of departure is the paradigm shift in hierarchies and the way in which this affects future modes of production and consumption, markets, consumers, and, accordingly, the future practices of designers and artists.</p>
<p>To equip students for these “next” economic scenarios, the programme proposes a form of “next design” aimed at future commercial contexts that are driven by people, not mass markets. One of the objectives is to enable art and design students to position themselves as creative practitioners towards the strategic use of design in current managerial perspectives, expressed in, for example, design thinking.</p>
<p>Hence, in relating to the current economic transformations, the programme specifically departs from methods that originate in aesthetics, imagination, and critical reflection. For example, students conduct provocative design research for innovative products, explore participatory ways of storytelling through online platforms in data design, question traditional market research aimed at masses instead of individuals in branding, and design experiences, services, and interactions for and with consumers, citizens, and other stakeholders for future markets.</p>
<p><strong>Speculative Scenarios For Real-life Innovations</strong></p>
<p>One of the perspectives in the programme includes the relation between speculation, innovation, and consumers in real life. Speculation is investigated as a creative approach to achieve imaginative and more extreme forms of innovation. It relates to the field of speculative design as defined by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby (Dunne &amp; Raby, 2011).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Their “what if” scenarios propose radical narratives for possible, often imaginary futures. As such, speculative design is positioned as design for debate rather than design for reality.</p>
<p>But what if this future increasingly involves emancipated consumers and citizens? Within this context we investigate how speculative, sometimes radical concepts and designs can be connected to the real world. Therefore, we do not address speculation in isolation as an expression of authorship or as design for debate, but rather connected to “real-life” innovations in an exchange process with “real people.” As a possible perspective, we expanded the “what if” scenario with the question “how else,” relating to Ahmed Ansari’s inclusive view on design: “‘How else’ emphasises a connection to current systems and structures where the principle project is framed not as an aesthetic, exploratory, intellectual exercise, but as a political, transformative, active enterprise” (Ansari, 2015).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Integrating speculation and real life, the “what if/how else” approach aims at challenging students to both experiment with a radical speculative attitude and to exchange their concepts in reality. Through this scenario we intend to encourage inclusive, potentially more valuable innovations with prospective consumers.</p>
<p><strong>From “What If” to “How Else”</strong></p>
<p>To arrive at the realistic “how else” as a “transformative enterprise” (Ansari, 2015) from the speculative “what if,” the role of design research with users and consumers is crucial. The design research we introduced in the programme focuses on developing creative, critical ways of conducting user and consumer research. As opposed to the anonymous data- and fact-driven market or user research, art and design students are able to use their unique artistic skills and imagination to unveil the personal stories, desires, dreams, or fears of users as input for more profound and valuable designs (Sanders &amp; Stappers, 2012).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>An example is the “Confrontation Piece,” a design research approach aimed at user engagement. It is derived from the cultural probe (Gaver, Pacenti &amp; Dunne, 1999), a method developed for interaction design: “a technique used to inspire ideas in a design process… a means of gathering data about people's lives, values, thoughts. Probes can be any sort of artefact (map, postcard, camera, object, diary, etc.) along with evocative tasks, which are given to participants to allow them to record specific events, feelings or interactions.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The Confrontation Piece is a less directly applied interpretation of the Cultural Probe. It encourages students to elicit stories from possible future consumers. In this process, they confront consumers with their concepts using tactics such as unexpected interventions or (un)familiar objects and visuals, in order to get less predictable, less factual feedback.</p>
<p>For the assignment “Secret Stories about Hidden Local Crafts” in Rotterdam-West, students used the Confrontation Piece to collect stories from craftspeople. One project focused on forgotten weaving techniques. As an intervention, students installed a public loom of extreme dimensions at the local market. A provocative form was used to incite specific stories about weaving from the neighbourhood. The giant loom succeeded as gathering place for collecting narratives. However, the stories did not only relate to weaving but much more to the daily lives of local people. This unexpected outcome changed the function of the final design. Based upon the responses the loom became a new product—a public storytelling tool.</p>
<p>In the project “Memre” (“Memory” in Surinamese), another student intended to discover secret stories about forgotten Surinamese crafts. He interviewed people using items like kernels, shells, and wood, mementoes from their past in Suriname. His Confrontation Piece eventually became an incentive for deeper storytelling. The responses inspired him to make a new product for this community, a memento kit that included an empty book for collecting personal histories.</p>
<p>By allowing the “how else” to the design process, the Confrontation Piece resulted in unexpected outcomes that reflected the stories of the people involved. Their feedback was used to create innovative products that did not yet exist. The process showed how a less strictly defined form of research into unknown needs could be used as a strategy for inclusive innovations and new, specific markets.</p>
<p><strong>From Probe to Provocation</strong></p>
<p>Working with the Confrontation Piece provided valuable information about the process of designing a new product as the result of personal, intimate user feedback. Based upon the possible potential of this inclusive design process, we decided to expand the spectrum of the cultural probe from the “how else” user-oriented Confrontation Piece to a more extreme “what if” artistic approach: the “Provocation Piece.” This research intervention focuses on testing radical scenarios in real life through a provocative design, in order to receive feedback about consumers’ desires, dreams, or fears. In the Provocation Piece, the speculative “what if” merges with the realistic “how else.”</p>
<p>The Provocation Piece was introduced in a course that focused on the design of a future “Internet of Things” product. Students developed several design research interventions, varying from role-play and disguises to presenting alienating objects to the people involved. The project “Itranscom” focused on future care. What if we could get access to the thoughts of people who cannot communicate anymore, for example, because of dementia? For this purpose the student proposed a data transmission system, represented by a small, round, flickering electronic object. Testing the “how else,” she used her alienating prototype in interviews with possible patients and caretakers. Her object incited profound conversations about life and death, providing her with new insights. An important outcome was the fear of privacy, which she eventually embedded in her final design concept.</p>
<p>“Real-Life Terra Fictions” was another assignment in which students explored the Provocation Piece. The course required a design for future landscapes and unknown territories and challenged students to make these extreme scenarios real for possible consumers.</p>
<p>The project “Re-embodiment of Human Treasures” focused on a selected group of 100 people who were nominated for a trip to Mars. The students used a provocative question: which earthly objects would they miss on Mars and how would they reproduce these with local Martian resources? To collect feedback they designed a kit containing a letter, together with pictures and objects of sentimental value. One Mars nominee returned the kit, including objects like a shell, a pinecone, and a violin, as well as a promise to collaborate in the project. By intertwining their “what if” speculations and the Mars nominee’s “how else” reality, the students were able to relate “terra fiction” to real-life “terra facts.”</p>
<p><strong>How Else?</strong></p>
<p>The projects and methods described above show a possible approach in art and design education towards a transforming economic environment. We focused on the current shift in hierarchies between producers and consumers and the emerging bottom-up, participatory attitude from consumers and users. Taking into account the aesthetic context, authorship, and artistic capacities of the students, as well as the stories and needs from consumers and users, we developed a design research approach that connects radical speculation with real-life scenarios. The examples given show that students came up with imaginative, innovative, and not yet existing products designed with and for their prospective consumers. However, seeking contact with the people involved proved to be difficult at times.</p>
<p>How can we further develop the “what if/how else” scenario in order to enable students to bring speculative ideas to real life? We propose <em>in situ</em> design labs that are interdisciplinary and participatory. These public field labs facilitate students’ research, experiments, and collaborations on urgent future questions together with engineers, scientists, advanced industries, local initiatives, and, not least, consumers and users. As such, these labs can expose students to real life and at the same time show their distinctive position as creative practitioners, collaborators, and innovators to an economic field that is in flux.</p>
